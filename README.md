# Rock Paper Scissors AI
This program is a little AI that play rock paper scissors with someone by collecting data on how he play.

# How to use it

* ## Play with the AI
    Open the .py file and enter your choice.

    I recommend to play 10 game minimum, the 5 first you just train the AI, and the 5 last you play with the AI and count wins.

* ## Show your statistics
    Open a terminal in the folder of the main program and enter :
    >python main.py --mode showstats

* ## Clear your statistics
    Open a terminal in the folder of the main program and enter :
    >python main.py --mode reset
